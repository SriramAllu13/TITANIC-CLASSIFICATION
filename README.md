# TITANIC-CLASSIFICATION
In this project, I delved into the world of data analysis and machine learning to tackle the challenging task of predicting passenger survival on the Titanic. Using data-driven insights and predictive modeling, developed a robust classification system.

## Project Overview:
ðŸ“Š Data Analysis: I explored the dataset, uncovering valuable insights about passenger demographics, ticket classes, and more.

ðŸ¤– Machine Learning: Using machine learning algorithms, I built a predictive model to classify passengers' survival. It's incredible how data can help us understand historical events!

ðŸ“ˆ Accuracy: Random Forest Classifier model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 86%, showcasing the power of data-driven decision-making.

Finally Created a Predicted data file that includes predicted values by my model including with PassengerId,Survived columns...

This project was not just about analyzing data but also about commemorating the lives lost on the Titanic. It's a reminder of the importance of learning from history and using data for impactful insights.
